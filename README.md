## Filters

I created this web app using React with Typescript and Material UI

To use it:

 - `npm i`, to install all deps
 - `npm start`, it will start a new broswer tab localhost port 3000

## Description
A small side project was made to show filters, allow user to add a filter and see the applied filters, with a responsive UI.

## Main Components

 1. Filters Container: a container that holds all state changes, logic and other child components.
 2. Filters Popover: a stateless component that renders a popover and list of filter buttons.
 3. Applied filters: a stateless component that renders all of the applied filters list.
 4. Many other smaller reusable components.
